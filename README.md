I'm primarily interested in **Automation** I am fascinated by the fact that I can utilize tool like Anaconda to extract any relavent information from a massive dataset with a few lines of code using python language. Using a small script I can program my computer to organize my files for me, I can tell my computer what to do, program it in the way I like rather than it telling me what to do. I find that really cool.
